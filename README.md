# Hello There 
<sub>General Kenobi</sub>  
  
I host and publish mostly meaningless stuff on the internet in order to obtain miniscule amounts of dopamine.  
I know how to use Python, Javascript and not really much else but I always give it my best go. :thumbsup:  
I don't do things for public very often (never), I really just post here at my own expenditure in the attempt at least one other person finds what I do useful. So far this has happened 0 times.  
If you really want to contact me, email me at `somebirb7190[at]gmail.com` as it's the best place.  
I appreciate your time reading this blank wall of text and I hope I didn't stop you from doing anything important.  
  
My greatest sincerities,  
~ Birb
